## Multi-DSL Reasoning

1. Drone HW Spec DSL --> Logical Encoding (encoding) DSL
2. Mission PLanner (P) DSL --> Logical Encoding (encoding) DSL
3. Energy Consuption Model DSL --> Logical Encoding (encoding) DSL

Goal: Analyze an end-to-end safety property; e.g., “drone will always have enough battery capacity to return to the base during the mission”
Need an ability to reason about interaction between mission logic and energy usage

Approach: Develop multiple DSLs to capture these aspects in separate programs
Translate these DSL programs into the logical encoding in FORMULA
Leverage the symbolic execution engine in FORMULA for cross-domain analysis


## On-going work on DSL for energy models

Enabling cross-domain analysis
- Extend the existing FORMULA backend with solvers for non linear arithmetics (e.g., dReal)

Explaining cross-domain inconsistencies 
- e.g., the drone runs out of battery before being able to return to the base
- When a counterexample is generated by the underlying solver, it is expressed in terms of low-level encodings in FORMULA
- Map the counterexample back to high-level DSL constructs 
- Generate an explanation for the root cause behind the cross-domain inconsistency
