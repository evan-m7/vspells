On-going work on DSL for energy models
{{< /lead >}}

##### Designing a mini-DSL for drone energy models
- Study a range of energy consumption models for drones
- Provide factors influencing energy (e.g., payload amount, flight altitude, mission parameters) as domain abstractions
- Encode the domain semantics (i.e., mathematical equations for computing energy consumption rate) in FORMULA
