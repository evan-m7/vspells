The field of robotics is ever growing with state spaces exploding due to their complexity.  With increasing complexity and the asynchronous nature of modern programs, comes the demand for more robust testing.  Current unit testing methods only cover a portion of code, do not efficiently search the entire state space, and often leave interleavings due to concurrency untested.  The P programming language is a modeling language and set of associated tools aimed at helping to create modular and safe distributed systems.
