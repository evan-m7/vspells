The Compositional DSLs for Enhancing Software (CODES) project is a collaboration between researchers at Vanderbilt University and Carnegie Mellon University as part of the DARPA Verified Security and Performance Enhancements for Large Legacy Software (V-SPELLS) program. Our team studies the use of domain-specific languages (DSLs) for specifying and enhancing software components and ensuring that these DSLs safely compose with a legacy system. 

In simpler terms: we develop ways to update older software in provably correct ways.

## Collaborations

The V-SPELLS program is collaborative in nature and structured around three task areas (TAs):
- TA1 teams perform code analysis to extract a DSL representation from software.
- TA2 teams (including us) define the DSLs and tools to reason about DSLs.
- TA3 teams flatten and optimize the DSL representation for insertion into the legacy system.
